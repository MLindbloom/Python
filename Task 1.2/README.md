# Python Achievement 1

## Task 1.2

### Learning Goals

- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for your Recipe app

### Recipe App Data Structure

In this project, we are developing a basic data structure to store recipes for a Recipe app. We'll be using Python and exploring different data structures to represent recipe information efficiently.

#### Choice of Data Structure

For storing information about each recipe, we have chosen to use dictionaries. Dictionaries offer key-value pairs, allowing us to organize recipe attributes such as name, cooking time, and ingredients effectively. This structure provides flexibility, allowing easy retrieval and modification of recipe details.

#### Steps

1. **Create `recipe_1` Structure**: We begin by creating a dictionary named `recipe_1` containing keys for name, cooking time, and ingredients.

2. **Create `all_recipes` Structure**: Next, we create an outer structure `all_recipes` to store multiple recipes. We chose a list data structure for `all_recipes` as it allows sequential storage and easy addition/removal of recipes.

3. **Add Recipes to `all_recipes`**: We generate four more recipes (`recipe_2` to `recipe_5`) and add them to `all_recipes`.

4. **Print Ingredients**: Finally, we print the ingredients of each recipe.

#### Deliverables
